# 90-percent-prediction-accuracy-Boston-Housing-Data

This project focuses on analyzing the Boston Housing dataset to explore the relationships between various factors (such as crime rate, average number of rooms, property tax, etc.) and the median value of owner-occupied homes. By leveraging Python libraries like Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn for data exploration and visualization, I aim to gain insights into the key drivers of housing prices in Boston.

Key Objectives:
Data Exploration: Explore the dataset using statistical summaries and visualizations to understand the distribution of features and the target variable (MEDV, median house value).

Feature Analysis: Analyze how different features like CRIM (crime rate) and RM (average number of rooms) correlate with house prices, using tools like Seaborn’s heatmaps and scatter plots.

Modeling: Build a predictive model using the RandomForestRegressor from Scikit-learn to predict house prices based on various input features. Evaluate the model's performance using metrics like Mean Squared Error (MSE) and R² score.

Data Splitting: Split the data into training and test sets using Scikit-learn's train_test_split method to assess the model’s performance on unseen data.

Visualization: Present the results through visualizations that demonstrate the relationships between features and target variables, as well as the effectiveness of the predictive model.
